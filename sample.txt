Machine Vision and Neural Networks Automated Fabric Inspection Systems Model Khaled Abouseada Department of Computer and Information Science CISC 4800: Special Topics in Computer Science Professor. 2 The main problem in Textile Industry is to increase the ratio between Quality and Productivity with high flexibility and minimization of the cost. So, it is so important to test the products to ensure quality. [...] But this person cannot work 24 Hours with zero faults, so the mill must have a lot of trained persons for these evaluations. [...] So, it is important to have on-line and high-speed quality controls to enable automation to improve quality value, in addition to increase of production speeds. [...] Image- processing techniques included operations performed by computer in order to carry out pre- programmed tasks and many people called this (machine-vision system). [...] Digital Images Fundamentals Image The digital form of an image is a 2-D Matrix where each element of the matrix contains a value represents the intensity of light of this pixel. [...] After classification the system determine the predicted sources for this fault and takes a decision for correcting it and for not being repeated. [...] A design of an automatic inspection machine is introduced for building the system of image acquisition, image enhancement, image analysis, features extraction and defects classification. [...] The design of this machine is adaptable for its function and easy for moving in small places.
